          TinyState is the Schema for the tinystates API.
          It stores runtime state for a TinyNode component, separate from configuration.
          TinyState should be owned by its TinyNode for cascade deletion.

              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.
