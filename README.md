# Tiny Systems Operator
Helm chart helps to deploy your own Tiny Systems modules

## Description
Single Helm chart for run any Tiny System module

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

## Helm charts
```shell
helm repo add tinysystems https://tiny-systems.github.io/module/
helm repo update # if you already added repo before
helm install my-corp-data-processing-tools --set controllerManager.manager.image.repository=registry.mycorp/tools/data-processing  tinysystems/tinysystems-operator
```

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```shell
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```shell
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/operator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```shell
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/operator:tag
```


### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```shell
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```shell
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```shell
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```shell
make manifests
```

### Create new api
```shell
kubebuilder create api --group operator --version v1alpha1 --kind TinySignal

```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
